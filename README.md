        - low-code
        - unified wrapper over major deep learning framework - keras, pytorch, gluoncv
        - syntax invariant wrapper

    Enables developers
        - to create, manage and version control deep learning experiments
        - to compare experiments across training metrics
        - to quickly find best hyper-parameters
